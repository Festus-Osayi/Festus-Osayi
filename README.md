<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
 Hello! I'm Festus Osayi, a computer programming graduate from Seneca College. My educational background equipped me with skills in mobile development, software testing, web development, distributed programming techniques, and database administration, and I have immersed myself in several programming languages and cutting-edge technologies because I have a deep interest in technology. My primary concentration has been full-stack development, and I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Working in various teams is a wonderful experience for me, and I'm eager to lend my abilities to unique projects and dynamic teams. Let's connect and talk about possible cooperation!
